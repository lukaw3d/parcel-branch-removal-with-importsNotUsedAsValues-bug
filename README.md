Current docs: https://github.com/parcel-bundler/website/blob/c0d46b1/src/features/production.md#development-branch-removal-branch-removal

```sh
$ yarn build
warning package.json: No license field
$ parcel build *.ts --no-source-maps
âœ¨ Built in 595ms

dist/a.js    116 B     83ms
dist/b.js      0 B    112ms
Done in 0.96s.
```
